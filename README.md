# MyMenu

Mucking about with personal menu planning.  Have been doing weekly menu planning since shortly after my son was born, but it's annoying to have to do it every week and remember what kind of things we like.  Figured I'd throw this together so that a computer could decide it for me, and eventually build out the grocery list too.

## To do

- Sample with weights but no replacement... hmmm
- Generate a veggie selection when generic veggies are present
- Dump groceries into [Wunderlist](https://developer.wunderlist.com/documentation)
