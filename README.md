# MyMenu

Mucking about with personal menu planning.  Have been doing weekly menu planning since shortly
after my son was born, but it's annoying to have to do it every week and remember what kind of
things we like.  Figured I'd throw this together so that a computer could decide it for me, and
maybe build out the grocery list too.

## To do

- Sample with weights but no replacement?
- Generate a veggie selection when generic veggies are present
- Dump groceries into [Wunderlist](https://developer.wunderlist.com/documentation), check out package https://github.com/mieubrisse/wunderpy2.
- Some kind of rule to pick one fish, one chicken, one veggie, etc. meal per week
- Include lunches?
- Collect feedback via emails?
- Dump meals into Google calendar?
- Integrate with Google docs for populating the options.yml?

## How do

Needs Python 3.7 for dataclasses, because why not
